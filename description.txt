This mod adds a new class by adding telekinetic weapons with their own damage type and resource, psychosis. New weapons, armors, accessories, and three buff potions are added. Current version is supported up to the end of pre-hardmode with custom items. Since this is an alpha, much is subjected to change and there are some known issues. This mod is open source. In general this mod covers...

- New class, the Esper, that deals telekinetic damage.
- Plenty of new weapons.
- Four new armor sets, plus eight helmet pieces.
- Some new accessories.
- Global damage bonuses (specifically the lowest value of the five vanilla damage types above 100%) will add to telekinetic damage. This also applies to telekinetic critical chance.

Vanilla changes...

- The flying knife is now a telekinetic damage weapon.

Known Issues because I either can code it better or can't due to hardcoding...

- Sawblades can get stuck on slopes.
- TK weapon collision on tiles can be janky.
- Shooters (currently the Spitting Sandfish and Super Spitting Sandfish) can be hard to aim when the screen scrolls.

Future Plans...

- More weapons, armors and accessories.
- Cross mod support to add new weapons and items to fit within the themes of the mods.
- Better balancing.
