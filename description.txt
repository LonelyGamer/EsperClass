This mod adds a new class by adding telekinetic weapons with their own damage type and resource, psychosis. New weapons, armors, accessories, and three buff potions are added. Current version is supported up to right after defeating Golem, inclunding drops from it. Since this is an alpha, much is subjected to change and there are some known issues. This mod is open source. In general this mod covers...

- New class, the Esper, that deals telekinetic damage.
- Plenty of new weapons.
- 5 new armor sets, plus 8 helmet pieces.
- Some new accessories.

Vanilla changes...

- The Flying Knife is now a telekinetic damage weapon.

Known Issues because I either can code it better or can't due to hardcoding...

- Sawblades can get stuck on slopes.
- Shooters (currently the Spitting Sandfish and Super Spitting Sandfish) can be hard to aim when the screen scrolls.
- Gravity Barrier Platform will display even when on the ground. Recommended to toggle accessory visibility off for it.

Future Plans...

- More weapons, armors and accessories.
- Cross mod support to add new weapons and items to fit within the themes of the mods.
- Better balancing.
- Add weapons for the following: 1 more Duke Fishron and Martian Madness, ocean biome chest, 2 Gravity Fragment, and 2 Moon Lord.
- Add Esper buff station.
- Right click function to hold certain Esper weapon types in place.
- Possible Twirlers rework to be unique.
- Possibly custom prefixes

- Hallowed accessories now only take 5 Hallowed Bars to craft instead of 10. Reforge value also dropped to 2 gold from 5 gold.
- Cambrian armor is now crafted at an anvil instead of a loom.
- Fixed some tooltips due to either not being constant with others (for True Goldropper compared to other canisters) or incorrect (Bowling Ball making mention of being consumable).
- Standardized the Wyvern Scale Vest to give 30% increased velocity for both throwing and telekinetic instead of different values.
- Renamed Psy Rockets to Psi Rockets.
- The rest of the non-sawblade projectiles janky collision should be fixed.
- Updated Boss Checklist support to correctly show all item drops that were missing from the previous update.
- Canister projectiles getting wider should no longer touch tiles beyond 10 pixels.
- Hallowed Lotus Petals now cost 3 Hallowed Bars instead of 5 and adjusted sell price accordingly.
- Psychosis meter when under the Psyched Out debuff will now animate even if the time of day counts differently.
- Boulder projectiles lose horizontal velocity slower.
- Boulder projectiles no longer despawn on collision while being controlled.
- Added Gravity Furniture in style of the 1.4 fragment furniture sets.
- Bowling Ball now has a unique sound on crit hits once during its lifespan.
- Added Icicle Spitter, a new Shooter type weapon that can drop from the Ice Queen. Also added Rolling Neutronium Core, Sharknado Rift, and Betsy Lobber.
- Buffed Spectre Rift damage from 72 to 96.
- Buffed Hellbat Jar damage from 24 to 28.
- Buffed Pixie Jar damage from 36 to 45.
- Buffed Wasp Jar damage from 50 to 75.
- Buffed Beetle Jar damage from 75 to 100.

- HUD is now much less janky and should position itself much better even when zooming in.
- Boulders upper damage now capped at 200% and lower damage at 50%.
- Lihzahrd Solar set bonus damage scaling and explosions now work for non-Esper Class telekinetic projectiles. Thus far, just the vanilla Flying Knife and Omni-Hammer's Telekinetic Hammer.
- Lihzahrd Solar set bonus explosion should now always deal damage regardless of enemy iframes from penetrating projectiles.
- Shaken jars now last for 8 seconds, up from 5.

- 0.7: Updated for tModLoader v0.11.8.6.
- Boulders (when held) and Lobber projectiles no longer go through platforms.
- Added use, held, and release sounds for telekinetic weapons.
- Added support for W1K's Weapon Scaling mod. This means weapons can be upgraded throughout the game. This is set for tier only, not fine tuned on a per weapon basis, so some weapons may be very powerful when upgraded.
- Consumable weapons are no longer consumable. They still function and drain psychosis faster as before. Sell prices and obtaining methods adjusted.
- TK weapons renamed to Psi. Display only name change, not code name change, so existing weapons won't be lost.
- Rift weapons will now fire at the closest target instead of the first detected enemy in range, much like how the Psi Prime Laser acts.
- Terra Vial Necklace will now correctly apply all debuffs instead of only 5 of them by using a custom debuff with all of the combined debuffs.
- Mostly added Boss Checklist's Boss Log support for this mod's loot, with the moon event bosses currently not covered.
- The method to add critical damage to telekinetic damage based on vanilla crit increases (due to no allCrit stat) no longer accounts for throwing crit chance, since newer mods tend to not touch it.
- Updated handling of Thorium Mod mod calls.
- Vortex Tower now drops Gravity Fragments.
- Canister projectiles now do more damage (up to 40% more) the higher up they fall onto mobs. They also get wider up to a limit as well.
- Desert Wanderer set bonus now reduces life drained while using Esper weapons in Over Psychosis state by 25% instead of giving 30% more psychosis regen.
- Taurus set bonus changed to allow a special kind of dashing that gives immunity frames, but costs psychosis to use.
- Added LuiAFK styled charms. While that mod is loaded, 30 of any Esper Class buff potion can be crafted into an unlimited charm that works while in the inventory. All 3 buff potion charms can also be combined.
- Fixed most of the janky collision with Esper projectiles, although sawblades remain unaffected.
- Added Gravity accessories.
- Added Gravity Drill.
- Buffed Psi Prime Saw damage from 48 to 60.
- Buffed damage from boulders rolling fast.
- Added several new weapons, with content for the hardmode dungeon, most of the moon event bosses (Ice Queen currently missing), Golem, a craftable post Golem weapon, a Solar Eclipse enemy, and even a single post Moon Lord weapon due to when the weapon sprites were made.

- 0.6.1: Switching away from the current TK weapon while using it now cancels its projectile in use. This should fix free psychosis usage if switching to a non-TK weapon and unintentional psychosis usage if no TK projectile is in use.
- Having Expanded Sentries loaded aside this mod without imkSushi's Mod also loaded should no longer cause an error stopping this mod and Expanded Sentries from loading together.
- Fixed Torch Twirler having the wrong dust and light.
- Multiplayer issues with psychosis should be fixed.

- 0.6: Added several new weapons, a helmet piece, and few accessories to cover the period between post mecha bosses and right after defeating Plantera.

- Jar weapons now require shaking in order to release projectiles. Also added shake effects for the Hellbat Jar and Pixie Jar.
- Standardized Esper buff potion durations to now all be 5 minutes long.
- Psychosis regeneration is now based on max base psychosis, not total psychosis from temporary boosts.
- Regenerating to full psychosis now has feedback similar to regenerating mana to full.
- Pixie Jar projectiles no longer can chase in water, based off of the Pixie NPC behavior.
- Changed the sell prices for many weapons, massively making them cheaper to reforge, although very few cost somewhat more to reforge.
- Did an overhaul of the UI code. Most of it is under the hood changes, but should make the UI function just a bit better, especially in regards to UI scaling.
- Fixed Skeleton Bone Lobber being sold pre-hardmode.
- The combat text from psychosis restoration is now pink instead of green.
- Using psychosis potions now damages the player equal to the amount of psychosis restored instead of triggering the Side Effects debuff.

- 0.5: Added several new weapons, armor, and accessories to cover early hardmode, up and including the mecha bosses. This includes two full armor sets (one in pre-hardmode) and seven armor pieces.
